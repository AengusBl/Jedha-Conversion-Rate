## Tracking Server

[The MLFlow tracking server](https://aengusbl-conversion-rate-tracking-server.hf.space)

Please note that the name of the "test_r2" column is a mistake I made when setting up the MLFlow logging: The scores are all F1 scores, but I could not change the name of the column after the fact, and I decided that it would be more confusing to have two score columns in the tracking server, so I left the name there for the sake of consistency. Sorry for any confusion this may cause.
